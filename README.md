Car driving game

As part of my CS112 project, I developed a captivating 2D Car Driving Game that utilizes the SFML graphics library to create visually stunning graphics and animations. The game is designed around the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming, including inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, resulting in a highly optimized and engaging gaming experience.

Players take control of the main car object, while other game objects such as other vehicles move in the opposite direction, controlled by the program. The game also includes a highway background, colored black with white stripes in the middle, and lush green bushes and trees on both sides, providing an immersive and realistic environment for the user.

The car object is controlled by the keyboard keys, allowing players to move the car forward, backward, left and right, changing its direction accordingly. Colliding with other game objects, such as cars or motorcycles, will result in game over, with the player's score displayed at the end of the game.

As the score increases, the game's difficulty level rises, with the speed of incoming vehicles from the opposite direction accelerating, adding a level of challenge and excitement to the gameplay. The car must defend itself from other game objects by moving in different directions to survive and achieve a high score.

The game features a starting menu and a play again option in the game over screen, with sound effects and a score display board that enhances the overall gaming experience. The combination of high-quality graphics, dynamic gameplay, and intuitive controls ensures that players of all ages will enjoy an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.

In conclusion, my 2D Car Driving Game is a highly immersive and challenging game that is sure to captivate players with its stunning visuals and intuitive gameplay mechanics. With its realistic environment, sound effects, and score display, it provides an unparalleled gaming experience that is sure to keep players coming back for more.
