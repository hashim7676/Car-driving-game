# Car-driving-game
I created a 2D Car Driving Game for CS112 using SFML graphics library, featuring OOP concepts, keyboard-controlled movement, and challenging gameplay. The car must defend itself from collisions with other vehicles while the difficulty increases with score, accompanied by sound effects and a score display board for a more immersive experience.
