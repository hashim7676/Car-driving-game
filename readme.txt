Car driving game


The 2D video game that I designed for the project of CS112 is a Car Driving Game. The platform that game will run on will be SFML graphics library which will help me with the graphics and animations that are used in my game and it will be based on the concepts of object oriented programming such as inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism etc.

The description for my game is that my game will be consisting a main Game Object which is the car that the user will control and there will be other Game Objects such as other vehicles moving in the opposite direction to my car, controlled by the program itself. The other game objects used in the game will be a highway colored black with white stripes in middle followed by bushes and trees in green color on both sides of the highway and other similar animation to make the user enjoy the game and will look more realistic. The highway will be my background game object on which my car will drive.


The functionality of my game will be basically that the my main object (car) will be moved in forward, backward, left and right directions with the help of keys of keyboard and the car will change its direction accordingly. If the car collide/touch with game objects (cars or motorcycles) the game will end and will show the score at the end of the game that how much you survive.

As the score increases, the difficulty level will also increase because the speed of the incoming vehicles from opposite direction will increase. Therefore it will become difficult to defend the car.

So basically my main object car has to defend itself from other game objects (cars) with the help of keys to move in other direction to survive and have a good record.

I have also added the sound effects and score on the board at the end also so that that the game will look more realistic. The game includes a starting menu and a play again option in the game over screen.

List of OOP concepts used in project:

1) CLASSES

2) INHERITANCE (classes interacting with each other)

3) ENCAPSULATION (data hiding, use of get set methods)

4) POLYMORPHISM (use of virtual functions)
